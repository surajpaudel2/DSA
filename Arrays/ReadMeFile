Steps to Find the Next Permutation
Identify the Pivot:

Definition: The pivot is the first element from the right end of the sequence that is smaller than its next element.
Purpose: The pivot indicates where the next permutation will be formed.
Example: For the sequence [1, 2, 4, 5, 3], start from the right:
3 is not greater than 5.
5 is greater than 4, so the pivot is 4.
Find the Rightmost Successor:

Definition: The rightmost successor is the smallest element in the suffix (the part of the sequence after the pivot) that is larger than the pivot.
Purpose: Swapping the pivot with this element ensures the smallest lexicographical increase in the sequence.
Example: In the suffix [5, 3] of [1, 2, 4, 5, 3], the smallest element greater than 4 is 5.
Swap the Pivot with the Successor:

What to Do: Swap the pivot with the identified rightmost successor.
Purpose: This swap creates the next lexicographical permutation.
Example: Swap 4 with 5 to get [1, 2, 5, 4, 3].
Reverse the Suffix:

Definition: Reverse the sequence after the original pivot position (i.e., the suffix) to make it the smallest possible order.
Purpose: Reversing ensures the next permutation is the smallest possible sequence that is still greater than the current permutation.
Example: Reverse the suffix [4, 3] in [1, 2, 5, 4, 3] to get [3, 4].
Final Sequence
Result: After reversing, the final sequence is [1, 2, 5, 3, 4].
Full Example Summary:
For the sequence [1, 2, 4, 5, 3]:

Pivot: 4 (because 4 < 5).
Rightmost Successor: 5 (smallest element in the suffix [5, 3] that is larger than 4).
Swap: [1, 2, 5, 4, 3].
Reverse Suffix: [1, 2, 5, 3, 4].
Thus, the next permutation after [1, 2, 4, 5, 3] is [1, 2, 5, 3, 4].

Key Points:
Pivot: Identifies where the change happens.
Rightmost Successor: Ensures minimal increase.
Swap and Reverse: Finalize the next permutation in lexicographical order.
