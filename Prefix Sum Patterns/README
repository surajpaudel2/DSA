-> Normally in prefix sum we try to get answer by using whether the current sum/ diffeence of current sum and given 'K'
has been seen or not.

-> Some important things learned :
    => Multiple
    	-> If some questions like multiple comes, then below maths can comes in handy sometimes.

    		if x % k = y then if you again add the k in x and do modulo by k again you will get the y again.
    			Example :
    				x % k == (x + k) % k


    => Frequency
        -> Sometimes this sort of question can be solved by using the sliding window as well, but if the frequency count
         question comes, like for the count the number of nice sub arrays, where we have to count how many times we have
          seen the odd numbers in this question one trick is to add count value in each and every iteration.

    => Trick by calculating sum :
        -> Odd or even
        -> Negative or positive

=> Trick Learned in Special Array II :
        -> For continuous odd number try to make the sum as same, don't change it so if we subtract we will get 0, else
        change the sum so that we will get different value and other than 0 which will be false
        -> Why this works ?
                -> Because it is continuous, so if everything is correct sum will never change and we will get 0.
