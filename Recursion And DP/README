=>When you have to do recursion on same value multiple times, for example in maximum average ratio where you might have to
 go to the same index multiple times, so in this particular condition think in terms of Bigger problem and the smaller
 problem. In such kind of problem, base case will also helps to avoid the recursion infinitely on the same index
 depending
  upon the
 condition. So it will help.
